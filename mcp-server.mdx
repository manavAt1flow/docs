## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic that enables AI applications to seamlessly connect with external data sources and tools. With MCP, AI assistants like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf can directly interact with the Tuesday Leads API.

## Benefits of Using Tuesday MCP Server

- **Real-time API access**: AI applications can make live API calls to search for people and companies
- **Contextual documentation**: AI can reference our complete API documentation to provide accurate guidance
- **Seamless integration**: Works with popular AI tools without custom code
- **Always up-to-date**: Automatically syncs with the latest API changes and documentation

## Installation

Install the Tuesday MCP server using the Mintlify MCP package:

```bash
npx @mintlify/mcp@latest add tuesday
```

This command will:
1. Download and configure the Tuesday MCP server
2. Add it to your MCP client configuration
3. Make it available in supported AI applications

## Supported AI Applications

The Tuesday MCP server works with any MCP-compatible client, including:

- **Claude Desktop** - Anthropic's desktop AI assistant
- **Cursor** - AI-powered code editor
- **Windsurf** - AI development environment
- Any other MCP-compatible application

## Available Tools

The MCP server provides the following tools:

### Search Tool
Search across the Tuesday Leads API documentation to get contextual information about:
- API endpoints and parameters
- Authentication requirements
- Error handling
- Rate limits and usage guidelines
- Code examples and best practices

## Usage Examples
